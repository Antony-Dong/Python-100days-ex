Adding a solution for question 91 that works. Unfortunately I cannot push to a different branch other than master and create a pull request since I get 403

l = []
string = input("Enter the string: ").split(' ')
for i in range(len(string)):

    l.append(string[len(string)-i-1][::-1])
a = ' '.join(l)
